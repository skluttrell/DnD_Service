Now they have built their own civilization in the depths of the Underdark, patterned after the Way of Lolth.\nAlso called dark elves, the drow have skin that resembles charcoal or obsidian, as well as stark white or pale yellow hair. They commonly have very pale eyes (so pale as to be mistaken for white) in shades of lilac, silver, pink, red, and blue.\nThey tend to be smaller and thinner than most elves.\n[h]the darkness of the drow[/h]Were it not for one renowned exception, the race of drow would be universally reviled. To most, they are a race of demon-worshiping marauders dwelling in the subterranean depths of the Underdark, emerging only on the blackest nights to pillage and slaughter the surface dwellers they despise. Their society is depraved and preoccupied with the favor of Lolth, their spider-goddess, who sanctions murder and the extermination of entire families as noble houses vie for position.\nYet one drow, at least, broke the mold. In the world of the Forgotten Realms, Drizzt Do\'Urden, ranger of the North, has proven his quality as a good-hearted defender of the weak and innocent. Rejecting his heritage and adrift in a world that looks upon him with terror and loathing, Drizzt is a model for those few drow who follow in his footsteps, trying to find a life apart from the evil society of their Underdark homes.\nDrow grow up believing that other surface-dwelling races are inferior, worthless&#8211;except as slaves. Drow who develop a conscience or find it necessary to cooperate with members of other races find it hard to overcome that prejudice, especially when they are so Often on the receiving end of hatred.\nDrow adventurers are rare. Check with your Dungeon Master to see if you can play one.',
